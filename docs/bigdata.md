# Big data
Big data refers to large volumes of structured and unstructured data that are generated by businesses, organizations, and individuals on a daily basis. This data comes from a wide range of sources, including social media, sensors, mobile devices, and transactional systems. Big data can be challenging to work with due to its size and complexity, and it requires specialized tools and technologies to store, manage, and analyze it. Big data has the potential to provide valuable insights and enable data-driven decision making, and it is used in a variety of fields, including business, research, and development. It is particularly important in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, where it is used to train and evaluate models.

### Overridden default Jekyll layouts

By default, Jekyll (and its default theme `minima`) provide the `about`, `home`, `page`, and `post` layouts. In Just the Docs, we override all of these layouts with the `default` layout. Each of those layouts is simply:

{% raw %}

```

layout: default

{{ content }}
```

{% endraw %}
